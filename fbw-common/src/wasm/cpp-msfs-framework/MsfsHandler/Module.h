/**
 * @brief The Module class is the base class and interface for all modules to
 * ensure that they are compatible with the MsfsHandler.
 *
 * Make sure to add an error (std::cerr) message if anything goes wrong and especially if
 * initialize(), preUpdate(), update() or postUpdate() return false.<p/>
 *
 * MSFS does not support Exception so good logging and error messages is the only way to inform the
 * user/developer if somethings went wrong and where and what happened.<p/>
 *
 * Non-excessive positive logging about what is happening is also a good idea and helps
 * tremendously with finding any issues as it will be easier to locate the cause of the issue.
